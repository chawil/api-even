# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most precedence.

# Please apply the following guidelines when updating this file.

# Paths and patterns
# ==================

# Paths should be ordered alphabetically (when precedence is not an issue).
# Avoid complex patterns, prefer full path targeting files or directories.

# When creating a more specific pattern of an existing more generic pattern:
# - The specific pattern must be listed below.
# - Teams and users of the generic pattern have to be copied to the specific
#   pattern, unless they approve to lose their ownership for the paths matched
#   by the specific pattern.

# Teams and users
# ===============

# Prefer using teams whenever possible, as members of teams and review
# assignation rules can be dynamically managed outside of this file without
# requiring a new commit.
# Only define users for specific cases.
# For each pattern: list teams first, then users, both alphabetically.

# Listed teams and users must have write permissions on the repository for the
# feature to work.
